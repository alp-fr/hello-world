# hello-world
This is the tutorial repository for "Hello world".

Hello! My name is Alp Aktuna. I have had a lot of code stored elsewhere on my laptop and other devices, and I am now prepared to place them in a code repository such as GitHub. 

I am a university student studying Plasma Engineering and Microelectronics with a focus on nanotechnology and semiconductors. These could not sound further from the traditional GitHub user demographic, but programming is prevalent in a variety of STEM disciplines and I am ready to collaborate and share ideas with the coding community. It is something I enjoy. Current computational interests of mine include shell-scripting, verification and validation (v & v), and human-computer interaction, particularly information visualization for processes and macro-/micro-visualizations for electronic hardware.

Thank you!
